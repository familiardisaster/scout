Don't judge - I have improved a lot since this script. My first attempt at bug bounty automation - I don't look at it as wasted time but instead as a fun learning experience. I have now learned there are much more efficient and effective ways to accomplish these things - but I know there is always a better way and more to learn. Something I love about bug bounty and programming.
